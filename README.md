This is a project, a visual representation of me trying to fully grasp the routing system and how it is fully applicable in a Next.js App.

## The project

Its basically a card project with little menu details on them and another dynamic routing for exploding on the full details of the card details on a different page (dynamic routing)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
